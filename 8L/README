mysterySort1 is bubble sort
Your evidence: When running and stopping the sort midway through it seems like
the larger numbers "bubble" to the top of the set, a characteristic trait of
the bubble sort.

mysterySort2 is heap sort
Your evidence: When running this sort, the large numbers are ordered at the end
and the numbers from the beginning to the middle are unsorted but descending until
they reach sorted ascending numbers.

mysterySort3 is insertion sort
Your evidence: The first some numbers are sorted and the rest are unsorted. Also,
it was the last one I looked at and it was the only sort that I hadn't deduced.

mysterySort4 is quick sort
Your evidence: It takes the shortest amount out of any of them. (about 200ms).

mysterySort5 is selection sort
Your evidence: If you run the sort for 10 seconds, the only difference is the
first element is in the right place.
